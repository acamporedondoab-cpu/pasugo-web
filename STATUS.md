# STATUS — Pasugo Delivery App

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-05 (Sprint 5 — MVP audit fixes, push notifications, retry logic, online/offline toggle)  
**Stack:** Next.js 14 · Supabase · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS  
**Deployment:** Vercel ✓ — https://pasugo-rides.vercel.app (commit `7b28cb6`)

---

## Current Sprint

**Sprint 5 — MVP Hardening (COMPLETE ✓)**

Full system audit completed. All critical and high-priority gaps resolved. System is MVP-ready.

**Previously:**
- Sprint 4 — UX improvements, call/message buttons, item photo capture (COMPLETE ✓)
- Sprint 3 — React Native / Expo Mobile App, GPS tracking, maps, fare estimates (COMPLETE ✓)
- Sprint 2 — Web UI, Auth, Customer UI, Rider Web UI, Admin Dashboard (COMPLETE ✓)

---

## What Is Built

### Planning Phase (COMPLETE)
- Project purpose, users, and service types defined
- Core user flow designed (marketplace model — no dispatcher)
- CLAUDE.md and project_specs.md finalized
- Order state machine designed and approved (9 states)
- Full database schema designed (orders, profiles, order_status_logs, rider_locations)
- All API endpoints designed and documented in project_specs.md

---

### Database (COMPLETE)
- Supabase project created: `mzdyjvvoltgarhkdtevc`
- `profiles` table — auto-created on auth signup via `handle_new_user` trigger
- `orders` table — full schema with all state fields and timestamps
- `order_status_logs` table — append-only audit log per status change
- `expires_at` auto-set to `NOW() + 2 minutes` via DB default

**RLS (Row Level Security) — IN PROGRESS**

Policies applied so far:

`profiles`:
- Authenticated users can SELECT their own row (`auth.uid() = id`)

`orders`:
- Customers can INSERT their own orders (`customer_id = auth.uid()`)
- Users can SELECT orders they're involved in (`customer_id = auth.uid() OR rider_id = auth.uid()`)
- Users can UPDATE orders they're involved in
- Riders can SELECT all `searching` orders
- Riders can UPDATE (accept) `searching` orders where `rider_id IS NULL`
- Riders can release (rider-cancel) their own accepted orders back to `searching` or `failed`

`order_status_logs`:
- Authenticated users can INSERT logs they author (`actor_id = auth.uid()`)
- Users can SELECT logs for orders they're involved in

---

### API Endpoints (COMPLETE ✓)

| # | Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `POST /api/orders` | DONE ✓ | Customer creates order |
| 2 | `POST /api/orders/:id/accept` | DONE ✓ | Rider accepts — atomic, concurrency-safe |
| 3 | `GET /api/orders/available` | DONE ✓ | Rider sees all searching orders |
| 4 | `POST /api/orders/:id/status` | DONE ✓ | Rider advances delivery status through all states |
| 5 | `GET /api/orders/:id` | DONE ✓ | Single order with full status log history |
| 6 | `POST /api/orders/:id/cancel` | DONE ✓ | Customer cancels (searching → arrived_pickup only) |
| 7 | `POST /api/orders/:id/rider-cancel` | DONE ✓ | Rider cancels, re-broadcasts; fails after 3 attempts |
| 8 | `POST /api/rider/location` | DONE ✓ | GPS ping during active delivery; validates active order |
| 9 | `POST /api/system/expire-orders` | DONE ✓ | Cron — mark timed-out orders as failed; service_role, bulk update |

---

### Auth (COMPLETE)
- Supabase Auth enabled (email/password)
- Test users created: `testcustomer@pasugo.dev`, `testrider@pasugo.dev`
- `handle_new_user` trigger auto-creates `profiles` row on signup
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` — SSR Supabase client (cookie-based, for browser)
- `lib/supabase/auth.ts` — `getUserFromRequest()` helper — supports both cookie auth (browser) and Bearer token auth (API/mobile)

---

## Bugs Encountered and Fixed

### 1. `next.config.ts` not supported in Next.js 14
**Error:** Next.js 14 does not support TypeScript config files (only Next.js 15+).  
**Fix:** Renamed to `next.config.mjs` and removed the TypeScript type annotation.

---

### 2. TypeScript error on `cookiesToSet` parameter
**Error:** Implicit `any` type on the `setAll` parameter in `lib/supabase/server.ts`.  
**Fix:** Imported `CookieOptions` from `@supabase/ssr` and added explicit type annotation.

---

### 3. Second user creation failed (`Database error creating new user`)
**Error:** `handle_new_user` trigger stored `''` (empty string) as phone for email-only users. UNIQUE constraint on `phone` rejected the second user.  
**Fix:** Made `phone` nullable. Updated trigger to use `NULLIF(COALESCE(NEW.phone, ''), '')`.

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ALTER COLUMN phone DROP NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ALTER COLUMN phone DROP DEFAULT;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, role, name, phone)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id, 'customer',
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', ''),
    NULLIF(COALESCE(NEW.phone, ''), '')
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

---

### 9. Signup trigger `type "user_role" does not exist` (SQLSTATE 42704)
**Error:** Auth log showed `ERROR: type "user_role" does not exist` during sign-up.  
**Root cause:** GoTrue runs in the `auth` schema context. The `user_role` enum lives in `public` and is invisible without full qualification.  
**Fix:** Cast to `public.user_role` and add `SET search_path = public` to the function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, role, name, phone)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    COALESCE((NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role')::public.user_role, 'customer'::public.user_role),
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', ''),
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'phone', '')
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public;
```

**Key lesson:** Supabase Auth trigger errors only appear in **Auth logs** (Dashboard → Authentication → Logs), not Postgres logs.

---

### 10. Photo update: `permission denied for table profiles` / `rider_profiles`
**Error:** `supabase.from("profiles").update(...)` returned permission denied even with RLS policy in place.  
**Root cause:** RLS policies control which *rows* can be accessed, but the `authenticated` role also needs table-level DML grants (`GRANT UPDATE`). Both layers are required.  
**Fix:**
```sql
GRANT UPDATE ON public.profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON public.rider_profiles TO authenticated;
```

---

### 4. PowerShell `curl` is not real curl
**Error:** `curl` in PowerShell is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest` with different syntax.  
**Fix:** Switched to `Invoke-RestMethod` with `@{ "key" = "value" }` hashtable headers.

---

### 5. API returned 401 despite valid Bearer token
**Root cause:** `@supabase/ssr` reads auth from cookies by default. Bearer token was only used for `getUser()` but all subsequent DB queries ran as `anon`.  
**Fix:** When Bearer token is present, create a plain `@supabase/supabase-js` client with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in global headers so all queries carry the JWT.

```typescript
if (token) {
  const supabase = createBrowserClient(url, anonKey, {
    global: { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } }
  });
  const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  return { supabase, user, error };
}
```

---

### 6. RLS blocking profile SELECT
**Error:** `authenticated` role had no table-level SELECT privilege on `profiles`.  
**Fix:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
GRANT SELECT ON public.profiles TO authenticated;
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own profile" ON public.profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

---

### 7. RLS blocking order INSERT and UPDATE
**Error:** After enabling RLS on `orders`, INSERT and UPDATE were blocked — no matching policies.  
**Fix:** Added policies for customers (INSERT), users (SELECT/UPDATE), riders (SELECT searching, UPDATE to accept).

---

### 8. RLS blocking rider-cancel (WITH CHECK violation)
**Error:** `new row violates row-level security policy for table "orders"` on rider-cancel.  
**Root cause:** The existing UPDATE policy's implicit `WITH CHECK` required `rider_id = auth.uid()` on the resulting row. Rider-cancel sets `rider_id = NULL`, so the check failed.  
**Fix:** Added a dedicated policy for rider cancellation:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Riders can release orders back to searching"
ON public.orders
FOR UPDATE
USING (
  auth.uid() = rider_id
  AND status IN ('accepted', 'en_route_pickup', 'arrived_pickup')
)
WITH CHECK (
  rider_id IS NULL
  AND status IN ('searching', 'failed')
);
```

---

## Test Script

`test-api.ps1` — 15-step automated end-to-end test. Run after `npm run dev`:

```
Step 1:  Sign in as customer
Step 2:  Create order (searching)
Step 3:  Sign in as rider
Step 3b: Get available orders — order appears in list
Step 4:  Rider accepts order (accepted, rider_id locked)
Step 5:  Advance → en_route_pickup
Step 6:  Advance → arrived_pickup
Step 7:  Advance → picked_up
Step 8:  Advance → in_transit
Step 9:  Advance → delivered
Step 10: Get order with logs — 7 log entries returned
Step 11: Create second order for cancel test
Step 12: Customer cancels it (cancelled, cancelled_by: customer)
Step 13: Create third order for rider-cancel test
Step 14: Rider accepts it
Step 15: Rider cancels it (back to searching, search_attempts: 2)
```

**Last result:** ALL 15 STEPS PASSED ✓ (2026-05-03)

---

## Sprint 3 — Mobile App Progress (pasugo-mobile)

### Customer Screens (COMPLETE ✓)
- **Login screen** — email/password, role-based redirect
- **Dashboard** — 3 service cards (Pabili, Pahatid, Pasundo) + Recent Orders section
- **New Order screen** — pickup/dropoff address, notes, service type pre-filled
- **Order tracking screen** (`/customer/order/[id]`) — live timeline, status badge, cancel button, "Order Delivered!" confirmation

### Rider Screens (COMPLETE ✓)
- **Dashboard** — available (searching) orders list + Recent Deliveries section, real-time updates, pull-to-refresh
- **Active Order screen** (`/rider/order/[id]`) — service-type-aware action buttons, 4-tap flow, cancel delivery

### Key Features Built
- `SafeAreaView` from `react-native-safe-area-context` used throughout (Android status bar inset)
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions on order rows (customer + rider)
- 8-second polling fallback alongside Realtime (catches missed events)
- Sign out on both dashboards, role-aware redirect after sign-in
- `skipRedirect=1` param to bypass active-order redirect when navigating home
- Two-`useEffect` pattern for Realtime — prevents "cannot add postgres_changes callbacks after subscribe()" error

### Backend Changes (deployed to Vercel)
- `POST /api/orders/:id/status` — updated to auto-advance `arrived_pickup → in_transit` atomically (records both `picked_up_at` and `in_transit_at`), reducing rider taps from 5 to 4

### Service-Type Aware Labels
- `pasundo` (fetch a person): "On the Way to Passenger", "Arrived at Location", "Passenger Boarded", "Arrived at Destination"
- `pabili` / `pahatid` (item delivery): "Heading to Pickup", "Arrived at Pickup", "Item Picked Up", "Mark as Delivered"

### Bugs Fixed This Sprint
| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| `"database error saving new user"` — `type "user_role" does not exist` | GoTrue runs in `auth` schema; enum must be fully qualified as `public.user_role`. Added `SET search_path = public` to trigger function. |
| Customer avatar_url stays null after photo upload | Two fixes: (1) added `GRANT UPDATE ON public.profiles TO authenticated`, (2) cache-busted URL with `?t=Date.now()` so React Native shows new photo |
| Rider photo_url stays null after photo upload | Same pattern: `GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON public.rider_profiles TO authenticated`; also fixed incorrect `.eq("user_id")` → `.eq("id")` (column is `id`, not `user_id`) |
| Back button hidden behind Android status bar | Switched all screens to `SafeAreaView` from `react-native-safe-area-context` |
| Sign-in broken after sign-out | `onAuthStateChange` now fetches role on sign-in event, not just sign-out |
| Home button looped back to order summary | Added `skipRedirect=1` param; dashboard skips `checkActiveOrder()` when present |
| Realtime error after subscribe() | Split into two `useEffect` hooks gated by `hasActiveDelivery` state |
| Customer "Order Delivered" never showed | Added explicit delivered terminal card + 8s polling fallback |
| `ReferenceError: Property 'TIMELINE' doesn't exist` | Fixed leftover reference after renaming to service-type-specific timeline arrays |
| Rider fare not visible before accepting | Added `pickup_lat/lng`, `dropoff_lat/lng` to dashboard query + fare-fetching `useEffect` |
| Customer map un-tappable after modal close | Removed `disabled={!riderLocation}`; always show `MapView` with fallback region from pickup/dropoff midpoint |
| Realtime "cannot add callbacks after subscribe()" | Unique channel name per mount via `useRef(\`rider-available-orders-${Date.now()}\`)` |
| Render error on "Back to Orders" from Recent Deliveries | Use `router.canGoBack()` — `router.back()` when stack exists, else `router.replace("/rider/dashboard")` |
| `ReferenceError: riderLocation doesn't exist` in openGoogleMaps | Removed `riderLocation` reference (belongs to customer screen); use `order` coords + live GPS state |
| Google Maps navigation skipped pickup waypoint (went rider→dropoff) | Switched to phase-based nav: pickup phase routes rider→pickup; dropoff phase routes pickup→dropoff |
| `localhost:3000/login` returned 404 | Login page lives at `app/auth/login/page.tsx` — correct URL is `/auth/login` |

### Rider Dashboard Improvements (COMPLETE ✓)
- Fare estimate shown on each available order card before accepting (spinner while fetching)
- `AvailableOrder` interface includes `pickup_lat/lng`, `dropoff_lat/lng` — used to call Directions API per card
- `useRef<Set<string>>` used to guard against re-fetching fares on re-renders (avoids infinite loop)
- Unique Supabase Realtime channel name per mount (`rider-available-orders-${Date.now()}` via `useRef`) — fixes "cannot add postgres_changes callbacks after subscribe()" error caused by two dashboard instances

### Rider Active Order — Phase-Based Google Maps Navigation (COMPLETE ✓)
- Navigation button label and destination change automatically based on order status
- `PICKUP_PHASE` = `{accepted, en_route_pickup}` → button says **"Navigate to Pickup"**, routes rider → pickup
- `DROPOFF_PHASE` = `{arrived_pickup, picked_up, in_transit}` → button says **"Navigate to Dropoff"**, routes pickup → dropoff
- `navPhase` derived value auto-switches when Realtime pushes a status update — no extra state needed
- Phase badge shown in the Route card header (blue for pickup phase, orange for dropoff phase)
- Android: opens `maps.google.com` web URL with `origin=` and `destination=`
- iOS: opens `comgooglemaps://?saddr=ORIGIN&daddr=DEST&directionsmode=driving` — if not installed, falls back to web URL
- When heading to pickup: origin = rider live GPS if available, else pickup coords
- When heading to dropoff: origin = pickup coords, dest = dropoff coords

### Rider Active Order — Live GPS Pin on Map (COMPLETE ✓)
- Rider's real-time GPS location shown as blue pin on both inline map and full-screen modal
- `expo-location` installed; `watchPositionAsync` updates position every 10 meters
- Location permission requested on screen mount
- **IMPORTANT: Requires native build — does NOT work with Expo Go**
- EAS build needed: `eas build --profile preview --platform android`

### New Order Screen — Service-Type-Aware Copy (COMPLETE ✓)
- `getScreenCopy(serviceType)` helper returns all UI strings based on service type
- `pasundo` (fetch a person): title = "Ride Details", pickup label = "Your location", dropoff label = "Destination", button = "Find a Rider"
- `pabili` / `pahatid` (item delivery): title = "Order Details", pickup label = "Pickup address", dropoff label = "Dropoff address", button = "Request Delivery"
- Button shows fare inline when calculated: `"Find a Rider · ₱{fare}"` or `"Request Delivery · ₱{fare}"`
- All hardcoded strings replaced; no duplicate copy logic

### GPS Map & Routing (COMPLETE ✓)
- Installed `react-native-maps` in pasugo-mobile
- Customer order screen (`/customer/order/[id]`) shows live `MapView` with orange rider pin + blue pickup + green dropoff pins
- Map visible only during active delivery states: `accepted` → `in_transit`
- Re-subscribes and re-fetches on screen focus (`useFocusEffect`) — fixes map disappearing after navigating home
- Placeholder shown if rider hasn't sent a ping yet
- Tap map → full-screen modal with all three pins (rider, pickup, dropoff)
- Rider order screen (`/rider/order/[id]`) shows route map with orange pickup + green dropoff pins
- Blue polyline drawn from pickup → dropoff via Google Directions API
- Distance badge shown (e.g. "3.2 km") — foundation for fare calculation
- Tap map → full-screen modal with full polyline route
- AddressPicker component captures coordinates at order creation (Google Places Autocomplete)
- `lib/places.ts` — `fetchSuggestions`, `fetchPlaceDetails`, `fetchDirections` (includes polyline decoder, no extra dep)
- **REQUIRED: Run RLS SQL below in Supabase SQL Editor before testing**

**RLS policies needed for `rider_locations` (run once in Supabase):**
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON public.rider_locations TO authenticated;

CREATE POLICY "Riders can insert own location"
ON public.rider_locations FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = rider_id);

CREATE POLICY "Customers can view rider location for their orders"
ON public.rider_locations FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.orders WHERE orders.id = rider_locations.order_id AND orders.customer_id = auth.uid())
);

CREATE POLICY "Riders can view own location pings"
ON public.rider_locations FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = rider_id);
```

**Android setup needed:**
- Replace `REPLACE_WITH_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `app.json` with a real Google Maps Android API key
- iOS uses Apple Maps by default — no key needed

---

### UI / Branding (COMPLETE ✓)
- Pasugo logo (`pasugo_logo_app.png`) added to:
  - Admin header (`app/admin/layout.tsx`) — 40×40px, rounded-lg, orange "Pasugo Admin" label
  - Auth login page (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`) — 80×80px centered above form
  - Mobile login screen (`pasugo-mobile/app/login.tsx`) — 96×96px centered brandBlock with tagline
- Logo asset copied to `pasugo-mobile/assets/logo.png` for local `require()` reference

### Customer Profile Photo (COMPLETE ✓)
- Photo uploads to Supabase Storage (`avatars` bucket) and persists `avatar_url` in `profiles` table
- Cache-busted URL (`?t=Date.now()`) forces React Native to reload image on same storage path
- Required SQL: `GRANT UPDATE ON public.profiles TO authenticated;`

### Rider Profile Photo (COMPLETE ✓ — pending APK rebuild)
- Photo uploads to `avatars` bucket, persists `photo_url` in `rider_profiles` table
- Fixed incorrect `.eq("user_id")` → `.eq("id")` (rider_profiles PK is `id`)
- Required SQL: `GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON public.rider_profiles TO authenticated;`

### Sprint 4 — UX Improvements & Communication Features (COMPLETE ✓)

#### Bugs Fixed
| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| Admin login redirected to `/customer/dashboard` | Indirect circular RLS recursion: `profiles` policy queried `orders`, which queried `profiles` → infinite loop. Fix: created `public.get_my_role()` SECURITY DEFINER function; rewrote orders policies to use `public.get_my_role() = 'rider'` instead of `EXISTS` on profiles. |
| "Failed to create rider profile" in admin dashboard | Route was inserting `name` and `phone` into `rider_profiles` but those columns don't exist. Fix: removed those fields from the insert in `app/api/admin/riders/route.ts`. |
| `permission denied for table profiles/rider_profiles` (service_role) | service_role lacked table-level grants. Fix: `GRANT ALL ON public.profiles TO service_role; GRANT ALL ON public.rider_profiles TO service_role; GRANT ALL ON public.orders TO service_role;` |
| "JSON Parse error: Unexpected character: T" on order creation (mobile) | `BASE_URL` in `lib/api.ts` pointed to deleted deployment `pasugo-beta.vercel.app`. Fix: updated to `https://pasugo-rides.vercel.app`. |
| `fetch(localUri).blob()` fails on React Native (photo upload) | React Native can't read local file URIs via `fetch().blob()`. Fix: use `FormData` with `{ uri, name, type }` — native networking layer handles local URIs through FormData correctly. |

#### Features Added
**Customer info on rider's available order cards (before accepting)**
- `customer_id` added to `AvailableOrder` interface and dashboard query
- Batch-fetches missing customer profiles from `profiles` table when orders change
- Shows customer avatar (or initial placeholder) + name on each card

**Rider details in customer's Recent Services**
- `rider_id` added to query; batch-fetches from `rider_profiles`
- Shows rider avatar + name on each completed order card

**Customer details in rider's Recent Deliveries**
- `customer_id` added to query; batch-fetches from `profiles`
- Shows customer avatar + name on each completed delivery card

**Call & Message buttons (rider ↔ customer)**
- Rider active order screen: "📞 Call" and "💬 Message" buttons in Customer card — visible while order is active
- Customer active order screen: same buttons in Your Rider card — visible once rider has accepted
- Uses `Linking.openURL("tel:...")` and `Linking.openURL("sms:...")` — opens native dialer/SMS app
- `Linking` already imported on rider side; added to customer screen imports
- No backend required

**Item photo capture (pabili & pahatid)**
- Rider sees "📷 Capture Item Photo" card at `arrived_pickup` status (not shown for `pasundo`)
- Tapping opens native camera via `expo-image-picker` (already installed)
- Photo uploaded to `order-photos` Supabase Storage bucket via `FormData` POST to Supabase Storage REST API
- `pickup_photo_url` saved on the order record
- Rider sees photo preview + "Retake Photo" option after capture; photo is optional
- Customer order screen shows the photo (with caption) once `pickup_photo_url` is set — persists through all subsequent statuses
- Required SQL (already run):
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE public.orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS pickup_photo_url text;
  INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) VALUES ('order-photos', 'order-photos', true) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
  CREATE POLICY "Riders can upload order photos" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'order-photos' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
  CREATE POLICY "Public can view order photos" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'order-photos');
  ```

---

### Sprint 5 — MVP Hardening & Push Notifications (COMPLETE ✓)

#### Audit Fixes
| Item | Fix |
|---|---|
| `search_attempts` not reset on new rider acceptance | Added `search_attempts: 0` to the atomic UPDATE in `POST /api/orders/:id/accept`. Prevents premature permanent-fail when a new rider accepts a rebroadcast order. |
| `expire-orders` cron never called | Added `vercel.json` with `schedule: "* * * * *"` pointing to `/api/system/expire-orders`. `CRON_SECRET` was already set in Vercel env vars. |
| Vercel deployment not confirmed | Verified `pasugo-rides.vercel.app` is live, current, and auto-deploys from GitHub `main`. All 4 required env vars confirmed set (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`). |

#### Features Added

**Rider Online/Offline Toggle**
- Green "● Online" / gray "○ Offline" pill in the rider dashboard header
- Tapping updates `rider_profiles.is_online` in Supabase immediately
- Offline riders see a placeholder screen — order list hidden, no Realtime events acted on
- `is_online` persists across app restarts (loaded from `rider_profiles` on init)
- Required SQL: `ALTER TABLE public.rider_profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_online boolean DEFAULT false;`

**Push Notifications for Riders (expo-notifications)**
- When a customer creates an order, `POST /api/orders` fetches all `is_online = true` riders with a saved `push_token` from `rider_profiles` and sends an Expo push notification via `exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send`
- Notification: title = "New Delivery Request 🛵", body = service type + pickup address, data = `{ orderId }`
- Fire-and-forget — push send never blocks the order creation response
- On rider side: permission requested + Expo push token saved to `rider_profiles.push_token` on every login
- Android notification channel configured (MAX importance, orange light, vibration)
- Tapping a notification navigates the rider directly to `/rider/order/:id` via `_layout.tsx` listener
- Requires native build — does NOT work in Expo Go
- Required SQL: `ALTER TABLE public.rider_profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS push_token text;`

**API Retry Logic (`lib/api.ts`)**
- `apiPost` and `apiGet` now retry once with a 1-second delay on network-level failures
- Only retries on fetch throws (connectivity loss) — 4xx/5xx errors are not retried

---

## Next Steps (Sprint 6 — Post-MVP)

### Immediate (before Play Store submission)
1. **Run SQL** — `ALTER TABLE public.rider_profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_online boolean DEFAULT false;`
2. **Run SQL** — `ALTER TABLE public.rider_profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS push_token text;`
3. **EAS Build** — `eas build --profile preview --platform android` in `F:\pasugo-mobile` to apply: push notifications, online/offline toggle, logo icon, all Sprint 4–5 features
4. **Create mobile GitHub repo** — `pasugo-mobile` has no remote; create repo and `git remote add origin <url> && git push -u origin master`

### Sprint 6 — Production Readiness
5. **Customer push notifications** — notify customer when rider accepts, arrives, and delivers (same Expo push pattern; save customer `push_token` in `profiles` table)
6. **Auto go-offline after delivery** — when rider completes a delivery, set `is_online = false` in `rider_profiles` so they don't receive new pings until they manually go back online
7. **Rate limiting on `POST /api/orders`** — prevent order spam; use Vercel Edge Middleware or Upstash Redis rate limiter (low priority — JWT required reduces risk)
8. **Order confirmation screen** — customer reviews order before submitting (spec item; currently goes straight to creation)

### Sprint 7 — Growth Features
9. **Ratings & reviews** — customer rates rider after delivery; visible on rider profile
10. **Earnings tracking** — rider sees per-delivery fare and running total in Recent Deliveries
11. **In-app chat** — replace call/SMS with an in-app message thread per order (Supabase Realtime `order_messages` table)
12. **Payment integration** — GCash / Maya / cash-on-delivery toggle; escrow pattern for digital payments
13. **Smart rider matching** — filter available orders by proximity (haversine distance); riders see closest orders first instead of all searching orders

---

## Order Lifecycle

```
searching → accepted → en_route_pickup → arrived_pickup
→ picked_up → in_transit → delivered

cancelled (customer cancels before pickup)
failed (timeout or rider abandons after pickup)
```

Full state machine and transition rules: see `project_specs.md`
